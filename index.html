            <p>Lentils are a small but mighty legume. They
                are supremely healthy, tasty, and sustainable!
                Lentils provide essential nutrients needed for a healthy diet.
                As the meat industry tortures animals and harms the humans who process meat,
                an alternative food source is needed for a healthy, happy soceity. Lentils
                are the answer! They provide all the nutrients that are typically obtained through
                animal products. That's why humans have been enjoying lentils since before pottery
                was invented!
            </p>
            <p>Lentils do not require much water, and they are nitrogen-fixing, that means
                they dont need as much fertilizer; this is hugely beneficial to the environment! 45% of the World's lentils are grown in Canada,
                the relatively infertile land there can handle this, as lentils are not a picky crop.
            </p>
            <p>Did I remember to mention how delicious they are? Heres a small sample of the many nutrients:</p>
